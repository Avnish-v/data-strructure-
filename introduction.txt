                            built in  
1. array 

  -------time complexity------------
    insert / remove from end  =  o (1) const 
    insert / removing  from beginning = o(n)
    Access  = o (1) const 
    search  = o(n)
    push / pop  =  o(1) const 
    shift /  unshift / concat  / slice / splice  =  o(n)
    foreach  /   map  /filter /redcuce = o(n)

2 .  object  

  an object is unordered collection of key value pair ..
  [] . notation obj is not iterable ..

---------time complexity----------

> insert /  remove  = o(1);
> access -  o(1);
> search - o(n);
> obj.keys () , obj.values() , obj.entries()  =  o (n);

3 .  set  

 .  a set ia a data structure  that can holds a collection pf values .  the values however must be unique 
 .  set can contain a mix of different data types. you can store strings, booleans , numbers oreven obj all in the same ..
 . set are the dynamically sized . you don't have to worry about the size of the set .
 . set does not maintain an insertion order .. 
 .set are iterable . they can be  used by for loop 

   -----. array |v/s| set --------
    .  array can contain  duplicate values whereas sets cannot
    . insertion order is maintain by array but it is not the case with sets
    . searching and deleting is faster in sets than compare to the arrays

    ----------- time complexity ---------


4.  map 

. A map is ordered collection of key value pairs. both the key and values can of any data types
. to retrive a value .you can use the coressponding keys
. maps are iterables  they can be iterate to  for - - -  similar to obj 

--------- obj |V/S|  map ----------------------

. objects are unordered whereas maps are ordered.
. keys in obj can only be string and sysmbol type whereas in map they can be of any type
. an object has prototype and may contain a few default keys which may collide with your own
  keys if you're not careful .  A map on the other hand does not contain any keys by default .
. objects are not iterable whereas maps are iterable
. the number of  items in an object must be determined manually whereas  it is readily available with 
  the size property in map
.  apart  from stroing data , you can attach functionality to an object whereas maps restricted to just storing data.
